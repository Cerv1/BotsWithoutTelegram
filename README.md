Using Telegram bots without Telegram.
===========
We're implementing an application in which we can use Telegram bot's features
from our client without the need of having Telegram installed. The client needs
to connect to our server in order to have this application running.

NEXT STEP: we want to add an user-friendly graphical interface, because command-line rules but... Nobody really wants it.
